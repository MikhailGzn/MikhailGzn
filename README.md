ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Mikhail! I'm passionate about *artificial intelligence* and *simulation development*. Since 2018, I've been immersed in the world of programming, with **Haskell** and **Python** being my favorite languages.

ðŸŽ“ Currently, I'm completing my Ph.D. in *mathematics* at *FAMAF*, representing my most ambitious project to date. As a *mathematics graduate* and aspiring *computer engineer*, I aim to merge my expertise in both fields.

ðŸ’¡ My constant desire for learning is my greatest motivation. I become engrossed in projects that I find fascinating, making it challenging to step away once I start working on them.

âœ¨ Join me on this journey where *curiosity* and *innovation* intersect! Let's build something amazing together!
