👋 Hi, I'm Mikhail! I'm passionate about artificial intelligence and simulation development. Since 2018, I've been immersed in the world of programming, with Haskell and Python being my favorite languages.

🎓 I am currently completing my Ph.D. in Mathematics at FAMAF, the most ambitious project I have undertaken so far. As a mathematics graduate and aspiring computer engineer, I am driven by the goal of merging rigorous mathematical thinking with real-world computational applications.

🤖 I also worked training AI models at Outlier, where I helped design, curate, and evaluate datasets for complex reasoning tasks in mathematics and programming. I was part of the team involved in building the SWE-Bench Pro dataset for benchmarking AI systems in real-world software engineering tasks.

💡 My constant desire for learning is my greatest motivation. I deeply enjoy projects that challenge me, and once I start working on something meaningful, it becomes difficult to walk away
